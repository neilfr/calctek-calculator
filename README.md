## Introduction

The masterminds at CalcTek have decided to revolutionize the calculator industry by building an API driven calculator. Genius! They've tasked you with developing the project.

### Requirements

Build an API that supports four types of calculation operators:

-   Addition
-   Subtraction
-   Division
-   Multiplication

Every calculation should be stored for historical reference.

A calculator interface should be created (Vue.js) that allows the user enter their calculation and receive a response.

A "ticker tape" interface should be built that shows all previous calculations with the ability to delete an individual calculation or clear all previous calculations.

### Stretch Goal

To really impress the customers of CalcTek, your calculator should support more complex calculation chains and even additional calculation operators:

`sqrt((((9*9)/12)+(13-4))*2)^2)`
